<tr><td>Screw connection</td><td>The two DOfs of a Cylindric joint can be
constrained in a screw-like connection by defining a ratio of translational to
rotational motion, called the screw ratio or <i>Output Ratio</i>. This ratio
determines how fast the slave rotates as it translates along the joint axis.
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 6.4.3 "Screw joint" for more information
about the screw ratio.</td></tr>
