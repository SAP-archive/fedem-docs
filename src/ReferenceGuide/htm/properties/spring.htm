<h1><a name="_properties_spring"></a>Spring</h1>

<p>The Spring object is used to introduce discrete stiffness in a FEDEM model.
There are two types of springs in FEDEM: Axial- and joint springs.
Axial springs apply relative forces between two
<a href="triad.htm">Triads</a> along the direction axis between the triads,
whereas Joint springs are integrated in the Joint, and act on the joint
triads along one of the unconstrained DOFs of the Joint.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Spring properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Length in model</td><td>The initial distance measured in the model
as you have made it. For joint springs, this is the measured value of the
joint DOF that the spring acts in. For axial springs, it is the distance
between the two Triads the spring is connected to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Constant stress free length, Constant deflection</td><td>
These buttons and fields work together allowing you to introduce prestress in
the spring, by setting a constant stress free length different from the
Length in model. You can chose to enter this property either as an
absolute value, using the Constant stress free length option, or relative to
the Length in model by selecting the Constant deflection option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stress free length change</td><td> You can select a
<a href="function.htm">Function</a> to change the stress free length of
the spring during the simulation. The value of the function will be used as
an addition to the constant stress free length defined above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness</td><td>In this field either a constant spring stiffness
can be entered, or you can select a defined spring characteristic
from the pull-down list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scale</td><td>The spring force can be scaled by a function.
This can for instance be used to switch the spring on and off during the
simulation. When no function is selected the scale is set to 1.0.
The Scale can not be a function of the spring deflection or length.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Note that if prestress is introduced in a Spring, it will be
accounted for in the very first iteration of the dynamics simulation
and may thus lead to a dynamic shock effect. However, when the initial
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Initial-Equilibrium">
Static equilibrium analysis</a> is enabled, the prestress force is taken
as a pure static load and the transient shock should be avoided.</p>
