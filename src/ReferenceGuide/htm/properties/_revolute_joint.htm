<h1><a name="_properties_revolute-joint"></a>Revolute Joint</h1>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/prp-revolute-joint-2.png"></p>

<p>The Revolute joint object is used to represent a Revolute joint in a FEDEM model.
The Revolute joint has one degree of freedom (DOF) that allows rotation of one
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> with respect to another Part, about a given axis
(the common Z-axis). Optionally, it may also have the freedom to translate one
Part with respect to the other Part along the common Z-axis.</p>

<p>Each Revolute joint uses two <a href="triad.htm">Triads</a>
to connect the joint to Parts. One of the Triads is labeled <i>master</i>
while the other one is labeled <i>slave</i>, with the constrained DOFs
of the slave triad following the movement of the master triad.
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Chapter 6 "Modeling of Joints".
To determine which Triad is the master and which is the slave,
select one of the Parts or the Revolute joint itself to examine the
<a href="../mainui/topology-view.htm">Topology panel</a> of master and slave
triads connected to the Part or Revolute joint. You can then select
(click and hold down the mouse button) the master- or slave triad to highlight
it in the <a href="../mainui/graphics-modeller.htm">Modeller</a> window.
You may also interchange the master and slave triads in a Revolute joint (unless
its master triad also is a slave triad in another joint), by by clicking the
<i>Swap Master and Slave Triad</i> button located underneath the
ID and Topology panel.</p>

<p>See the section on "Joints" in the "Mechanism Elements" chapter in the
FEDEM User's Guide, for more information on Revolute joints.</p>
