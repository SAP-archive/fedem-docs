<h1><a name="_properties_beam"></a>Beam</h1>

<p>The Beam object is used to to represent a two-noded beam finite element
in a FEDEM model. The Beam is connected to a <a href="triad.htm">Triad</a>
at each end of the element. However, an arbitrary number of beam elements may
be connected in one Triad, such that it is possible to represent both a curved
(or straight) beamstring and 3D spaceframe structures.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Beam properties, which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Cross-section</td><td>This pull-down list enables the selection of the
<a href="beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a> to be used for this beam element.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass and Length</td><td>Displays the length and the total mass
of the beam element. The length is computed from the coordinates of the
end triads, and the mass is computed from the length, and the cross
section area and mass density, assigned via the cross section object.
These fields are updated automatically if any of the referred property
objects are changed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualize 3D</td><td>This toggle enables a 3D visualization of
the beam, using the cross section parameters to render its actual geometry.
The default visualization is a straigth line connecting the two triads,
with coloring depending on the referred cross section object.
The <i>Start</i> and <i>Stop</i> fields are used to specify a sector of partial 3D visualization.
They define the start and stop angles (in degrees), relative to the local
Y-axis of the cross section, of the sector that is to be rendered in 3D.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Structural Damping</td><td>Allows you to change the values of
the mass- and stiffness-proportional damping for the Beam.
These fields are equivalent to similar fields in the
<a href="part.htm#Part">Part tab</a> of the Part property panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scaling of Dynamic Properties</td><td>Allows you to scale
stiffness and mass of each individual Beam in the dynamics simulation.
These fields are equivalent to similar fields in the
<a href="part.htm#Part">Part tab</a> of the Part property panel.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Local Z-axis definition</td><td>These three fields allow you to specify
a vector defining the Z-axis of the local coordinate system of the beam element.
This vector is defined in the coordinate system of the parent
<a href="sub-assembly.htm">Subassembly</a> of the Beam, or in the global
coordinate system in case of no parent assembly.
The local Y-axis is then defined as the cross product between the Z-axis
and the local X-axis, the latter being the unit vector from end 1 towards end 2 of the element.<br>
NOTE: If the specified vector is parallel to the local X-axis, or if all fields are zero,
a globalized coordinate system is used instead in which the local Z-axis is chosen to be as close as possible to the global Z-axis.
</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><table border="1" bgcolor="#ffffe0"><tr><td>
<b>Important:</b> Be careful when modifying the Beam properties when multiple beams are selected.
FEDEM will assign the values in the property panel to all the selected items.
You should therefore not set Visualize 3D on multiple beams by multiselecting them,
since it will then change all properties of all selected beams.
