<h1><a name="_properties_damper"></a>Damper</h1>

<p>The Damper object is used to introduce discrete damping in a FEDEM model.
There are two types of dampers in FEDEM: Axial- and joint dampers.
Axial dampers apply relative forces between two
<a href="triad.htm">Triads</a> along the direction axis between the triads,
whereas Joint dampers are integrated in the Joint, and act on the joint
triads along one of the unconstrained DOFs of the Joint.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Damper properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Damping coefficient</td><td>In this field either a constant damping
coefficient can be entered, or you can select a defined damper
characteristic from the pull-down list.
<tr><td>Scale</td><td> The damper force can be scaled by a function.
This can for instance be used to switch the damper on and off during
the simulation. When no function is selected the scale is set to 1.0.
The Scale can not be a function of the damper velocity or length.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use deformational velocity</td><td> This option is available if
the damper is acting together with a spring with a forced change in its stress
free length. The option enables the usage of the deformational velocity of
the connected spring, when evaluating the damper. The deformational velocity is
the spring velocity without the velocity component coming from a forced change
in the stress free length.</td></tr>
