Beamstring</h1>

<p>The Beamstring object is a sub-assembly used to represent long beam structures, such as risers, conductors, umbilicals, etc.</p>

<p>The Beamstring sub-assembly normally contains sets of
<a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a>s and
<a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a>s in its model tree list.
In addition, it contains some <a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a>s
and <a href="../material.htm">Material</a>s used by the <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements.

<p>Please see the chapter on "Marine Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide
for more information on how to create beamstring assemblies.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Beamstring properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Subassembly model file</td><td>Specifies a model file for the beamstring.
A separate model file may be assigned to the beamstring assembly by using the Browse button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Is internal to:</td><td>Currently unused.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Displays the total mass of the beamstring
(excluding additional mass due to marine growth and/or internal liquid).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length</td><td>Displays the total length of the beamstring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualize 3D</td><td>Enables or disables 3D visualization of the
<a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements, using the cross section parameters
to render its actual geometry. If disabled, each beam is visualized as
a straigth line connecting the two triads, with coloring depending on the referred
<a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a> object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Start, Stop</td><td>Specify start and stop angles (in degrees,
relative to the local Y-axis of the beam cross section)
for a partial 3D visualization of the beams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Internal Liquid</td><td>Enables or disables the calculation of additional mass due to
internal liquid (mud) in the beamstring, based on the specified Mud density and Mud level.
See the chapter on "Marine Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide for details on this
additional mass calculation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass proportional</td><td>Specifies mass proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness proportional</td><td>Specifies stiffness proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness scale</td><td>Specifies stiffness scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass scale</td><td>Specifies mass scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Position</td><td>Specifies the position of the beamstring assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orientation</td><td>Specifies the orientation of the beamstring assembly.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>If a separate model file is assigned to a beamstring assembly, all beams, triads
and properties of that beamstring are stored in the specified file when the model is saved.
It is then possible to reuse this beamstring in another model by importing it into an existing model.
If the <i>Subassembly model file</i> field is left empty, the elements of the beamstring are stored in
the main model file together with the rest of the model.</p>

<p>Editing any of the Structural Damping and Scaling of Dynamic Properties fields,
the values entered will apply to all the underlying <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements of the beamstring,
which can be verified by selecting any of the beam elements.
But, if such a field is edited for one beam element such that the beams
making up a beamstring no longer have identical properties, the corresponding field
in the Beamstring property panel will be blank (no value displayed).

<p>Note: The Visualize 3D toggle has a tri-state value.
In addition to the usual ON and OFF states,
it can also have a neither-ON-nor-OFF state, in which the corresponding
ON/OFF settings on each underlying beam element are applied instead.
This is usually the default setting for such tri-state toggles.</p>
