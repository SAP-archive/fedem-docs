Soil Pile</h1>

<p>The Soil Pile object is a sub-assembly used to represent a hollow or solid pile that has been placed in the marine soil.</p>

<p>The Soil Pile sub-assembly normally contains the same sets of objects in its model tree list as a
<a href="beamstring.htm">Beamstring</a>, (<a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a>,
<a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a>s, <a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a>s,
and <a href="../material.htm">Material</a>s).
In addition, it contains a set of <a href="../free-joint.htm">Free Joint</a>s with
corresponding Spring characteristic objects, representing the soil behaviour in the model.</p>

<p>Please see the chapter on "Marine Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide
for more information on how to create soil pile assemblies.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Soil Pile properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Subassembly model file</td><td>Specifies a model file for the soil pile.
A separate model file may be assigned to the soil pile assembly by using the Browse button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Displays the total mass of the soil pile
(excluding additional mass due to internal soil).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length</td><td>Displays the total length of the soil pile.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualize 3D</td><td>Enables or disables 3D visualization of the
<a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements, using the cross section parameters
to render its actual geometry. If disabled, each beam is visualized as
a straigth line connecting the two triads, with coloring depending on the referred
<a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a> object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Start, Stop</td><td>Specify start and stop angles (in degrees,
relative to the local Y-axis of the beam cross section)
for a partial 3D visualization of the beams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Internal Soil</td><td>Enables or disables the calculation of additional mass due to
internal soil in the pile, based on the specified soil density.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass proportional</td><td>Specifies mass proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness proportional</td><td>Specifies stiffness proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness scale</td><td>Specifies stiffness scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass scale</td><td>Specifies mass scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Position</td><td>Specifies the position of the soil pile assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orientation</td><td>Specifies the orientation of the soil pile assembly.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>If a separate model file is assigned to a soil pile assembly, all beams, triads
and properties of that soil pile are stored in the specified file when the model is saved.
It is then possible to reuse this soil pile in another model by importing it into an existing model.
If the <i>Subassembly model file</i> field is left empty, the elements of the soil pile are stored in
the main model file together with the rest of the model.</p>

<p>Editing any of the Structural Damping and Scaling of Dynamic Properties fields,
the values entered will apply to all the underlying <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements of the soil pile,
which can be verified by selecting any of the beam elements.
But, if such a field is edited for one beam element such that the beams
making up a soil pile no longer have identical properties, the corresponding field
in the Soil Pile property panel will be blank (no value displayed).

<p>Note: The Visualize 3D toggle has a tri-state value.
In addition to the usual ON and OFF states,
it can also have a neither-ON-nor-OFF state, in which the corresponding
ON/OFF settings on each underlying beam element are applied instead.
This is usually the default setting for such tri-state toggles.</p>
