Vessel Motion</h1>

<p>The Vessel Motion object is used to represent the motion of a rigid floating
marine vessel through a Response Amplitude Operator (RAO).
An RAO expresses the motion of a point on the vessel as a function of
the wave height and frequency at the same reference point.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/prp/vessel-motion-1.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Vessel Motion properties,
which consists of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>RAO file</td><td>Specifies a file containing the RAO table(s) describing
the vessel motion as functions of wave elevation and frequency.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wave function</td><td>Specifies the
<a href="wave-function.htm">Wave Function</a> defining the wave height,
angular frequency and phase delay, used by the six motion
<a href="../function.htm">Function</a>s associated with the vessel motion object.
Normally, this should be the same function as specified as the Wave function
in the <a href="../../dialogbox/Marine/sea-environment.htm">Sea Environment</a>
dialog, but is not necessarily so.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wave direction</td><td>Specifies the angle (in degrees) between the
local X-axis of the <i>Vessel Triad</i> and the incomming wave direction.
A zero wave direction means that the waves propagate in the direction of
the negative local X-axis of the Vessel Triad and the value 90.0 means that
the waves propagate in the direction of the negative Y-axis.
A separate RAO table is associated with each of the direction angles available
in the specified RAO file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Motion scale</td><td>Specifies a <a href="../function.htm">Function</a>
to be used as a scaling on the six motion functions associated with the vessel motion.
This can be used to ramp up the RAO motions in a smooth manner,
to avoid undesired startup trascients. When a function is specified here,
six new motion functions are generated, where each one is defined as the
product of the original motion function and the scaling function.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Please see the chapter on "Marine Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide, for
more information on the RAO file format and how the motion functions associated
with the vessel motion object are defined.</p>
