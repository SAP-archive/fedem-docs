<h1><a name="_properties_jacket"></a>
Jacket</h1>

<p>The Jacket object is a sub-assembly used to represent a marine spaceframe structure.</p>

<p>The Jacket sub-assembly normally contains sets of
<a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a>s and
<a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a>s in its model tree list.
In addition, it contains some <a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a>s
and <a href="../material.htm">Material</a>s used by the <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements.

<p>Please see the chapter on "Marine Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide
for more information on how to create spaceframes.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Jacket properties,
which consist of the folliwing items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Subassembly model file</td><td>Specifies a model file for the spaceframe.
A separate model file may be assigned to the jacket assembly by using the Browse button.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Displays the total mass of the spaceframe structure
(excluding additional mass due to marine growth and/or internal liquid).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Center of Gravity</td><td>Displays the location of the spaceframe's
center of gravity, in either Global coordinates or in Local coordinates
with respect to the origin of the jacket assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualize 3D</td><td>Enables or disables 3D visualization of the beams,
using the cross section parameters to render its actual geometry. If disabled,
each beam is visualized as a straigth line connecting the two triads,
with coloring depending on the referred
<a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a> object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass proportional</td><td>Specifies mass proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness proportional</td><td>Specifies stiffness proportional structural damping.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness scale</td><td>Specifies stiffness scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass scale</td><td>Specifies mass scale.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Position</td><td>Specifies the position of the jacket assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orientation</td><td>Specifies the orientation of the jacket assembly.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>If a separate model file is assigned to a jacket assembly, all beams, triads
and properties of that spaceframe are stored in the specified file when the model is saved.
It is then possible to reuse this spaceframe in another model by importing it into an existing model.
If the <i>Subassembly model file</i> field is left empty, the elements of the spaceframe are stored in
the main model file together with the rest of the model.</p>

<p>Editing any of the Structural Damping and Scaling of Dynamic Properties fields,
the values entered will apply to all the underlying <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements of the spaceframe,
which can be verified by selecting any of the beam elements.
But, if such a field is edited for one beam element such that the beams
making up a spaceframe no longer have identical properties, the corresponding field
in the Jacket property panel will be blank (no value displayed).

<p>Note: The Visualize 3D toggle has a tri-state value.
In addition to the usual ON and OFF states,
it can also have a neither-ON-nor-OFF state, in which the corresponding
ON/OFF settings on each underlying beam element are applied instead.
This is usually the default setting for such tri-state toggles.</p>
