<tr><td>Friction</td><td>Specifies the friction in the Ball joint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Joint DOF</td><td>Specifies which of the three joint DOFs that shall
receive the friction moment. The effective normal load in the friction is then
computed from the other two joint DOFs that are orthogonal to the selected DOF.
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 6.5 "Joint Friction".</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Free</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all
joint DOFs to Free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Fixed</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all
joint DOFs to Fixed.</td></tr>
