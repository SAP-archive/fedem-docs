<h1><a name="_properties_turbine"></a>
Turbine</h1>

<p>The Turbine object is a sub-assembly used to represent a wind turbine model in FEDEM.</p>

<p>The Turbine sub-assembly with all its sub-components are created from the
<a href="../../dialogbox/Windpower/turbine-definition.htm">Turbine Definition</a> dialog.
In its model tree list, it typically contains a <a href="rotor.htm">Rotor</a>,
a <a href="nacelle.htm">Nacelle</a> and a <a href="tower.htm">Tower</a>, which
again contain further sub-components themselves.
In addition, it contains some <a href="../beam-cross-section.htm">Beam cross section</a>s
and <a href="../material.htm">Material</a>s used by the <a href="shaft.htm">Shaft</a>s,
the Yaw <a href="../revolute-joint.htm">Revolute Joint</a> that connects the
<a href="nacelle.htm">Nacelle</a> and <a href="tower.htm">Tower</a>,
and a <a href="../free-joint.htm">Free Joint</a> connecting the tower to the ground.
The latter is represented by a single <a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a> that may be
reattached to a substructure, if the turbine model is to be placed on a flexible
(or floating) foundation.</p>

<p>Please see the chapter on "Wind Power Modeling" in the FEDEM User’s Guide,
for more information on wind power modeling and simulation in FEDEM.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Turbine properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Displays the total mass of the turbine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Center of Gravity</td><td>Displays the location of the turbine's
center of gravity, in either Global coordinates or in Local coordinates
with respect to the origin of the turbine assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Position</td><td>Specifies the position of the the turbine assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orientation</td><td>Specifies the orientation of the turbine assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wind reference point</td><td>Specifies a <a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a>
and a vertical offset that together define the reference point (origin) for the wind field.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Advanced topology settings</td><td>Specifies some objects whose locations are required
in the calculation of the aerodynamic forces on the turbine.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Normally, there is no need to change the
<i>Wind reference point</i> and <i>Advanced topology settings</i>.
They are set automatically when generating a turbine model from the
<a href="../../dialogbox/Windpower/turbine-definition.htm">Turbine Definition</a> dialog.
However, sometimes the settings can become lost when modifying
the components of the turbine. If you for example were to delete the
tower of the turbine, you would see that the Reference triad and the
Yaw point triad will be unassigned. If you later add a tower manually,
you would have to reset these fields to proper values.</p>
