Tower</h1>

<p>The Tower object is a sub-assembly used to represent the turbine tower in a wind turbine model.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/prp/tower-1.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the Tower properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass</td><td>Displays the total mass of the tower.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Center of Gravity</td><td>Displays the location of the tower's
center of gravity, in either Global coordinates or in Local coordinates
with respect to the origin of the tower assembly.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visualize 3D</td><td>Enables or disables 3D visualization
of all the <a href="../beam.htm">Beam</a> elements the tower consists of.
</table></p>

<p>The default Tower representation in FEDEM consists of a single Generic
<a href="../part.htm">Part</a>, and a
<a href="../triad.htm">Triad</a> in each end of the tower.
A tower model may have to be a bit more complex than that,
which is why we offer additional approaches for modeling the tower.
Please see the chapter on "Wind Power Modelling" in the FEDEM User's Guide
for details on these approaches.</p>

<p>Note: A valid wind turbine model is not required to contain a separate Tower object.
The tower may optionally be an integrated part of the underlying support structure.
It may then be modelled manually, by importing a FE Part or through other means.</p>

<p>Note: The Visualize 3D toggle has a tri-state value.
In addition to the usual ON and OFF states,
it can also have a neither-ON-nor-OFF state, in which the corresponding
ON/OFF settings on each underlying beam element are applied instead.
This is usually the default setting for such tri-state toggles.</p>
