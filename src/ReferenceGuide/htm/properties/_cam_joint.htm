<h1><a name="_properties_cam-joint"></a>Cam Joint</h1>

<p>The Cam joint object is used to represent a Cam joint in a FEDEM model.
A Cam joint has one (or two) spring-damper constrained DOFs, and five (or four)
unconstrained DOFs that allow the slave triad (called the follower) to move
over a curved surface (or curve), referred to as the cam surface.
The cam surface is defined by a curve consisting of circular arc segment.
Each arc segment is defined by the location of three master triads.
A Cam joint must consist of one slave/follower triad and at least three
master triads. See also the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 6.3.3 "Cam joint."</p>

<p>See the section on "Joints" in the "Mechanism Elements" chapter in the
FEDEM User's Guide, for more information on Cam joints.</p>
