The available options here depend on the selected <i>Constraint Type</i>,
which can be as follows:<ul>
<li><i>Free</i> - This DOF is free to move and no constraint is applied.
This is the default setting.
<li><i>Fixed</i> - This DOF is fixed and can not be moved at all.
It is eliminated from the system of equations (condensed out).
<li><i>Prescribed</i> - This DOF can be assigned a time-dependent prescribed
motion, and is thus condensed out from the system of equations.
<li><i>Spring-Damper</i> - This DOF is free to move, but a spring and/or damper
may be applied to constrain the motion.
</ul></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Free</i> joint DOF properties,
and consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Additional BC</td><td>When this toggle is enabled, the movement in this
joint DOF is fixed during the initial equilibrium analysis and optionally also
in the eigenmode analysis.
(See the <a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Eigenmode">Eigenmode tab</a>,
and the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 7.8 "Quasistatic equilibrium".)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load magnitude</td><td>You can apply a Load in this joint DOF.
This will be a torque or a force depending on whether this DOF is
a rotation or translation.
<tr><td>Initial velocity</td><td>You may specify a velocity
that should be applied as initial condition in this joint DOF,
i.e., the actual velocity at the start time of dynamics simulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length/Angle in model</td><td>This field shows the initial value
of this joint DOF as modeled. For rotational DOFs the value can be edited to
set a different initial rotation state. The 3D modeller view will then update
instantly, showing the new orientation of the joint symbol.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apply in frequency domain</td><td>If a <a href="function.htm">Function</a>
is specified in the <i>Load magnitude</i> field, this toggle will enable the
load to be applied in the frequency domain instead of the time domain,
if the <i>Frequency response analysis</i> toggle is enabled in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-basic.htm">Solver setup</a> dialog.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/joint-3.png"></p>

<p>The <i>Fixed</i> joint DOF properties are the same as for <i>Free</i> DOFs,
except that the <i>Additional BC</i> toggle here is always inactive,
and the <i>Load magnitude</i> and <i>Initial velocity</i> fields,
as well as the <i>Apply in frequency domain</i> toggle, all are absent,
as illustrated in the figure above.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/joint-4.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Prescribed</i> joint DOF properties,
and consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Prescribed quantity</td><td>You may choose whether you want to prescribe
the Deflection, the Velocity or the Acceleration for the joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial velocity</td><td>You may specify a velocity
that should be applied as initial condition in this joint DOF,
i.e., the actual velocity at the start time of dynamics simulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length/Angle in model</td><td>This field shows the initial value
of this joint DOF as modeled, and has the same interpretation as when the
joint DOF is <i>Free</i> (see above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Constant length/angle, Constant displacement/rotation</td><td>
These buttons and fields work together to allow you to set a constant
prescribed value of the joint DOF during the dynamics simulation.
You can choose to enter the constant length/angle either as an absolute value,
or relative to the Length/Angle in model, if the Prescribed quantity is set to
Deflection. For prescribed Velocity or Acceleration, you enter the constant
velocity/acceleration that should be applied in the first of these two fields
(the other field is inactive).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length/Angle change</td><td>You can prescribe the evolution of the
motion during the simulation through a function. The function controls the
change in the DOF valie relative to the Constant length/angle, or the
change of the velocity/acceleration relative to the Constant
velocity/acceleration, in case Velocity or Acceleration is prescribed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apply in frequency domain</td><td>If a <a href="function.htm">Function</a>
is specified in the <i>Length/Angle change</i> field, this toggle will enable the
prescribed motion to be applied in the frequency domain instead of the time domain,
if the <i>Frequency response analysis</i> toggle is enabled in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-basic.htm">Solver setup</a> dialog.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Note that if you prescribe a length/angle that differs from the Length/Angle
in model, this difference will be accounted for in the very first iteration of
the dynamics simulation and thus lead to a dynamic shock effect. However, when
the initial <a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Initial-Equilibrium">
Static equilibrium analysis</a> is enabled, the force due to this difference is
taken as a pure static load and the transient shock should be avoided.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Spring-Damper</i> joint DOF properties,
and consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Additional BC</td><td>When this toggle is enabled, the movement in this
joint DOF is fixed during the initial equilibrium analysis and optionally
also in the eigenmode analysis. It has the same interpretation as when the
joint DOF is "Free" (see above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load magnitude</td><td>You can apply a Load in the joint DOF,
similarly as when the joint DOF is <i>Free</i> (see above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial velocity</td><td>You may specify a velocity that should be
applied as initial condition in this joint DOF, similarly as when the joint DOF
is <i>Free</i> (see above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length/Angle in model</td><td>This field shows the initial value
of this joint DOF as modeled, and has the same interpretation as when the
joint DOF is <i>Free</i> (see above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Constant stress free length/angle, Constant deflection</td><td>
These buttons and fields work together allowing you to introduce prestress in
the spring, by setting a constant stress free length/angle different from the
Length/Angle in model. You can chose to enter this property either as an
absolute value, using the Constant stress free length/angle option,
or relative to the Length/Angle in model by selecting the Constant deflection
option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stress free length/angle change</td><td> You can select a
<a href="function.htm">Function</a> to change the stress free length/angle of
the spring during the simulation. The value of the function will be used as an
addition to the constant stress free length/angle defined above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stiffness</td><td>In this field either a constant spring stiffness
can be entered, or you can select a defined spring characteristic
from the pull-down list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring properties; Scale</td><td>The spring force or torque can be
scaled by a function.
This can for instance be used to switch the spring on and off during the
simulation. When no function is selected the scale is set to 1.0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Damping coefficient</td><td>In this field either a constant damping
coefficient can be entered, or you can select a defined damper characteristic
from the pull-down list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Damper properties; Scale</td><td>The damper force or torque can be
scaled by a function.
This can for instance be used to switch the damper on and off during the
simulation. When no function is selected the scale is set to 1.0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use deformational velocity</td><td> This option is available if
the damper is acting together with a spring with a forced change in its stress
free length. The option enables the usage of the deformational velocity of
the connected spring, when evaluating the damper. The deformational velocity is
the spring velocity without the velocity component coming from a forced change
in the stress free length.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Note that if prestress is introduced in a joint DOF spring, it will be
accounted for in the very first iteration of the dynamics simulation and
may thus lead to a dynamic shock effect. However, when the initial
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Initial-Equilibrium">
Static equilibrium analysis</a> is enabled, the prestress force is taken as a
pure static load and the transient shock should be avoided.</p>
