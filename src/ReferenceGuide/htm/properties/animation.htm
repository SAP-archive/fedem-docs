<h1><a name="_properties_animation"></a>Animation</h1>

<p>The Animation object is used visualize kinematic motions and structural results of the model.
This includes <a href="part.htm">Part</a> motion and deformation,
and various scalar result quantities visualized as color contour plots.
You can create several Animation objects in a model with different options for each.
The created Animations can then be loaded into the Modeler window one at a time.</p>

<p>The figures above illustrate the Animation properties,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Type</td><td>You can switch between three different animation types:<br>
- <i>Time History</i>: Visualizes time history results.
This can be the rigid body component of Part motion calculated in the dynamics solver,
or recovered stress, strain and the deformational part of the Part motion.<br>
- <i>Eigen Mode</i>: Visualizes the shape of a system eigenmode at a specific point in time.
It can also be used to visualize the component mode shape of an FE Part,
or the free-free mode shape of a reduced FE Part.<br>
- <i>Time Summary</i>: Visualizes accumulated structural results within a specified time interval.
These types of results are produced by running the Strain Coat Recovery Summary.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load face contours</td><td>If this toggle is enabled, the results
specified in the <i>Contours</i> tab are loaded and displayed as color contours
on the element faces of the mechanism assembly.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load line contours</td><td>This toggle controls whether or not the results
specified in the <i>Contours</i> tab are displayed as color contours on the FE-mesh lines.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load deformations</td><td>If this toggle is enabled,
Part deformations are loaded and displayed, if such results are present.
If this toggle is disabled, or stress recovery has not been performed,
only the rigid body motion of each Part is displayed.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load Animation</td><td>Click this button to actually load the animation
using the current property settings.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time Window</td><td>You can choose to display the complete duration
of the simulation or a specific time interval.
If you select <i>Time Interval</i>, specify the values for the interval's
<i>Start</i> and <i>Stop</i> time.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Animation Frames</td><td>These options are useful if you specified different
time steps for the dynamics simulation and the stress recovery calculation.
Enabling <i>For every time step</i> loads deformation results and color contour
values for all the time steps for which such results have been calculated
within the time window specified.
For all the other time steps only the rigid body Part motion will be displayed.
If you enable <i>Only for requested results</i>, only those time steps having
deformation/contour results will be loaded.

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Contour value</td><td>These options are used to select
the results that will be displayed as color contours.<br>
- <i>Result class</i>: Selects the FE entities for which you want to show color contours.
You can select either <i>Node</i>, <i>Element</i> (one single result for each element),
or <i>Element node</i> (one result value for each node within an element).<br>
- <i>Result</i>: Specifies which type of result to display in the animation.
The options available here depend on the <i>Result class</i> setting,
and on the results currently available in the results database.<br>
- <i>Operation</i>: Specifies the scalar value to extract from the selected result,
if that is a non-scalar quantity.
The operations available depend on both the <i>Result class</i> and <i>Result</i> settings.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Result Set</td><td>This setting is used to distinguish between
multiple results for the specified FE entity, including results from different
layers within an element or multiple deformation results on a node.<br>
- <i>By operation</i>: Consolidates the result set of the same type
using the selected operation (<i>Average</i>, <i>Maximum</i>, <i>Minimum</i>, etc.).<br>
- <i>By name</i>: Loads and displays only the result sets with the specified name.
Elements of an FE Part without that result set will be rendered gray,
whereas complete Parts without that result set will remain unchanged.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Averaging</td><td>These options control how a continuous contour plot is
obtained when the underlying results are discontinuous across the finite elements.
They are available only when the selected <i>Result class</i> is <i>Element node</i>.<br>
- <i>Operation</i>: Selects the averaging operation to use (<i>Average</i>, <i>Max</i>,
<i>Min</i>, etc.), or select <i>None</i> if averaging is not wanted.<br>
- <i>on</i>: Averaging on <i>Node</i> calculates a single value for each node
in the FE model, based on the selected <i>Operation</i> and the values specified
in the <i>Contour Value</i> settings.
Averaging on <i>Element</i> calculates a single value for each element in the same way.<br>
- <i>Max shell average angle</i>: Specifies an angle above which the averaging between shells stops.
The angle is used as a tolerance when comparing the globalized coordinate systems of
the elements in question.<br>
- <i>Average across element type</i>: Toggles averaging of contour values across element type borders.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multiple Face Results</td><td>Specifies the averaging behavior across elements that interface
on a surface (such as stacking of elements with the same size and shape but different thicknesses).
You can either specify an averaging operation, or select a named element group containing the result
to be shown.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Export animation automatically to VTF</td><td>Enables export of the animation to a VTF-file
after a batch stress recovery, if FEDEM is run with the command-line option -exportAnimation.
</td></tr>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mode Selection</td><td>These options are available for <i>Eigen Mode</i> animations:<br>
- Select between <i>System modes</i>, <i>Component modes of part</i> and
<i>Free-free modes of reduced part</i>.<br>
- <i>Time</i>: For <i>System modes</i>, this pull-down list shows the
times at which an Eigenmode solution is specified in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Eigenmode">Eigenmode tab</a>
of the Dynamics Solver Setup dialog.<br>
- <i>Part</i>: For <i>Component modes of part</i> or <i>Free-free modes
of reduced part</i>, this pull-down lists all FE Parts in the model.
It also have an entry <i>(All parts)</i> to enable simultaneous mode shape
animations for all FE Parts.<br>
- <i>Mode</i>: Shows either the modes specified in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Eigenmode">Eigenmode tab</a>,
the component mode numbers in the <a href="part.htm#Reduction-Options">Reduction Options tab</a>
of the Part property, or the free-free mode numbers for the reduced part,
depending on the selected mode type in the first pull-down list.<br>
- <i>Scale</i>: Specifies a scaling factor to exaggerate the shapes during the animation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Frame Generation</td><td>These options set the number of animation frames
and the duration of the animation:<br>
- <i>Frames per cycle</i>: Entering a higher value increases the continuity of the animated motion.<br>
- <i>Length</i>: Specify either a <i>Time</i>, <i>No. of cycles</i>, or <i>Until % damped</i>
to limit the duration of the animation.
These fields are available only for <i>System modes</i>.
For the other two options the duration of the animation will always be equal one full cycle.
