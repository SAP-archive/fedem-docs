<h1><a name="_properties_free-joint"></a>Free Joint</h1>

<p>The Free joint object is used to represent a Free joint in a FEDEM model.
The Free joint has six degrees of freedom (DOFs) that allow rotation of one
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> with respect to another Part about three axes,
and the translation of on Part relatively to the other one in three
independent (orthogonal) directions.</p>

<p>Each Free joint uses two <a href="triad.htm">Triads</a>
to connect the joint to Parts. One of the Triads is labeled <i>master</i>
while the other one is labeled <i>slave</i>, with the constrained DOFs
of the slave triad following the movement of the master triad.
The three rotational DOFs of the Free joint are defined by the angles between
the master triad and the slave triad in the x-, y-, and z-directions.
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Chapter 6 "Modeling of Joints".
To determine which Triad is the master and which is the slave,
select one of the Parts or the Free joint itself to examine the
<a href="../mainui/topology-view.htm">Topology panel</a> of master and slave
triads connected to the Part or Free joint. You can then select
(click and hold down the mouse button) the master- or slave triad to highlight
it in the <a href="../mainui/graphics-modeller.htm">Modeller</a> window.
You may also interchange the master and slave triads in a Free joint (unless
its master triad also is a slave triad in another joint), by by clicking the
<i>Swap Master and Slave Triad</i> button located underneath the
ID and Topology panel.</p>

<p>See the section on "Joints" in the "Mechanism Elements" chapter in the
FEDEM User's Guide, for more information on Free joints.</p>
