<h1><a name="_properties_cylindric-joint"></a>Cylindric Joint</h1>

<p>The Cylindric joint object is used to represent a Cylindric joint in a FEDEM model.
A Cylindric joint has four unconstrained DOFs that allow both translational
displacement along the local z-axis, and rotation about the local z-axis.
It does not constrain motion in the other two rotational directions.</p>

<p>The Cylindric joint has two joint DOFs. They are the translational distance
along the local z-axis from the first master to the slave (the slider variable)
and the angle of rotation of the slave about the local z-axis.
The rotation angle is measured between the x-axis of the first master triad and
the x-axis of the slave triad.</p>

<p>See the section on "Joints" in the "Mechanism Elements" chapter in the
FEDEM User's Guide, for more information on Cylindric joints.</p>
