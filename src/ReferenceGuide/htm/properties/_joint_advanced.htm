<p>The figure above shows the <i>Advanced</i> properties of the joint,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Formulation</td><td>Alters the rotational formulation of the joint.
The following choices are available:<br>
- Sequential rotation, Follower axis - Euler angle parametrization.<br>
- Sequential rotation, Orthogonal axis - Euler angle parametrization.<br>
- Rotational vector - Singularity free Rodriguez parametrization.<br>
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 2.3 "Finite rotations"
for further details on these choices. The Sequential rotation formulation
may lead to singularities in the rotation update computations if the joint
undergoes a 90 degrees rotation about the local Y-axis. If you have such
behavior in the joint, you can use the <i>Rotational vector</i> formulation to
achieve proper results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sequence</td><td>Alters the update sequence of the Euler angle
parameters. The default sequence is Z-Y-X.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring inter-connectivity</td><td>Specifies how the (translational- and
rotational) joint springs should be inter-connected (Cylindrical or Spherical
coordinates). This can be used to describe the cylindrical or spherical behavior
of rubber bushings, or pin joints with clearances. If you want the spring
characteristics in the joint variables to be interpolated resulting in a
cylindrical/spherical behavior, select the proper setting from the drop-down
list. See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 5.1.1 "Interconnected Spring Elements"
for details on how this affects the stiffness matrix.</td></tr>
