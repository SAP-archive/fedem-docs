<h1><a name="_properties_triad"></a>Triad</h1>

<p>The Triad object is used to define connection points between mechanism elements,
such as parts, beams, joints, axial springs and dampers, in a FEDEM model.
Triads are also used as attack point for external concentrated loads and point masses.
A Triad defines a set of three orthogonal coordinate axes at the connection point,
which serve as the reference frame for the 6 degrees of freedoms (DOFs) at this point
(three translations <i>Tx</i>, <i>Ty</i>, <i>Tz</i>, and three roations <i>Rx</i>, <i>Ry</i>, <i>Rz</i>).</p>

<h2><a name="General"></a>General tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-1.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>General</i> properties of the Triad,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>FE Node</td><td>ID number of the FE node to which the selected Triad is attached.
The value N/A here indicates a Triad that is not connected to an FE Part.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Free</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all triad DOFs to Free.
This button is not present for slave triads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Fixed</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all triad DOFs to Fixed.
This button is not present for slave triads.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Additional Masses</td><td>Enables you to apply additional mass and inertia at this point.</td></tr>
<tr><td>System directions</td><td>This pull-down list enables you to select reference coordinate system
for the DOFs associated with this Triad.<br>
- Global : The global inertial coordinate axis directions are used.<br>
- Local, initial : The local axis directions of this Triad in its modelling configuration are used.<br>
- Local, withrotated : The local axis directions of this Triad that follow the deformation of the model during simulation are used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Surface connector</td><td>If the Triad has a surface connector associated with it,
this pull-down list enables you to switch the type of this connector between Flexible and Rigid.
<tr><td>Summary table</td><td>An overview of the triad DOF properties is provided here.
This table is for viewing only and can not be edited.<br>
- Constraint - Shows the enforced Constraint type for this DOF.<br>
- Load/Motion - Shows the applied load or prescribed motion in this DOF.<br>
- Initial velocity - Shows the initial velocity for this DOF.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h2><a name="Origin"></a>Origin tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-2.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Origin</i> properties of the Triad,
which consist of the following items:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Position</td><td>This frame displays data for the translational part of the Triad location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orientation</td><td>This frame displays data for the rotational part of the Triad location.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reference CS</td><td>Each part of the Triad location can be displayed and edited in any coordinate
system defined in the model. These pull-down lists allow the reference coordinate systems to be selected.
They can also be selected by picking in the Modeler or selected from the Objects Browser
To do so, you must first click the arrow button next to the pull-down list.
Any Triad, Beam or Part can be selected.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coordinate type</td><td>This pull-down lists control how to display and edit
the Position and Orientation of the Triad.
</table></p>

<p>In the <i>Position</i> frame, the <i>Coordinate type</i> options are either Cartesian or Cylindrical coordinates,
and with Cylindrical coordinates either X, Y or Z can be chosen as the cylinder axis.</p>

<p>In the <i>Orientation</i> frame, the <i>Coordinate type</i> options are as follows:<ul>
<li><i>EulerZYX, as X, Y, Z</i> - Angles (in degrees about) the X-, Y- and Z-axes.
This means a rotation about the Z-axis of the reference CS performed first,
next about the Y-axis, and finally the X-axis.
<li><i>Point on Z-axis, and in the XZ plane</i> - Together with the triad
position itself, this uniquely defines the coordinate system.
<li><i>Point on X-axis, and in the XY plane</i> - Together with the triad
position itself, this uniquely defines the coordinate system.
<li><i>X vector, and XY vector</i> - The specified X-vector is used directly,
and the Z-vector is defined from the cross product between the two vectors.
</ul></p>

<h2><a name="DOF"></a>Triad DOF tabs</h2>

<p>These tabs display detailed properties related to each of the six DOFs
(<i>Tx-Rz</i>) associated with the Triad.
The available options here depend on the selected <i>Constraint type</i>.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-3.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Tx-Rz</i> properties of the Triad
when the Constraint type is <i>Free</i>, and consist of:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Load magnitude</td><td>You can apply a Load in this triad DOF. This will be
a torque or a force depending on whether this is a translational or a rotational DOF.
The load is applied in the defined System direction of the Triad.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apply in frequency domain</td><td>If a <a href="function.htm">Function</a>
is specified in the <i>Load magnitude</i> field, this toggle will enable the
load to be applied in the frequency domain instead of the time domain,
if the <i>Frequency response analysis</i> toggle is enabled in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-basic.htm">Solver setup</a> dialog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial velocity</td><td>You may specify a velocity that should be applied
as initial condition in this DOF, i.e., the actual velocity at the start time of the
dynamics simulation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Additional BC</td><td>When this toggle is enabled, the movement in this
triad DOF is fixed during the initial equilibrium analysis and optionally also
in the eigenmode analysis.
(See the <a href="../dialogbox/solver-advanced.htm#Eigenmode">Eigenmode tab</a>,
and the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 7.8 "Quasistatic equilibrium".)</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-4.png"></p>

<p>When the Constraint type is <i>Fixed</i>,
no further property items are available as illustrated in the figure above.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-5.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Tx-Rz</i> properties of the Triad
when the Constraint type is <i>Prescribed</i>, and consist of:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Motion magnitude</td><td>You can prescribe a constant deflection,
velocity or acceleration by typing the desired value into this field,
or a time-dependent evolution of the motion during the simulation by
selecting a function.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Prescribed quantity</td><td>You may choose whether you want to
prescribe the Deflection, the Velocity or the Acceleration for the triad DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Apply in frequency domain</td><td>If a <a href="function.htm">Function</a>
is specified in the <i>Motion magnitude</i> field, this toggle will enable the
prescribed motion to be applied in the frequency domain instead of the time domain,
if the <i>Frequency response analysis</i> toggle is enabled in the
<a href="../dialogbox/solver-basic.htm">Solver setup</a> dialog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Initial velocity</td><td>You may specify a velocity that should
be applied as initial condition in this triad DOF, i.e., the actual velocity
at the start time of the dynamics simulation.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Caution: When using a prescribed non-constant motion in triad DOF,
it is the analysts responsibility to also specify an initial velocity that
complies with the specified motion. Failure to do so may result it unwanted
ficticious transcients in the beginning of the simulation.</p>

<p>You may plot the reaction force associated with a fixed or prescribed triad
DOF by selecting the "Force" or "Moment" item under the Triad node in question
form the RDB selector (see "Selecting RDB results" in FEDEM User's Guide,
"Curve properties").</p>


<h2><a name="Results"></a>Results tab</h2>

<p><img src="../../img/prp/triad-6.png"></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the <i>Results</i> properties of the triad.
It contains toggles for activating output of certain solution variables
related to the triad, such that the quantities are available for curve plotting,
etc.</p>

<p>In the <i>Global</i> frame, the following toggles are available:</p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Name:</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Velocity</td><td>Output velocities in global coordinates

<tr><td>Velocity</td><td>Output velocities in the local coordinate system
of the triad when this toggle is enabled, no output when disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Acceleration</td><td>Output accelerations in the local coordinate system
of the triad when this toggle is enabled, no output when disabled.</td></tr>
