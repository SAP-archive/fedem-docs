<tr><td>Friction</td><td>Specifies the friction in the Free joint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Joint DOF</td><td>Specifies which of the six joint DOFs that shall
receive the friction force or moment. The effective normal load in the friction
is  computed from the two joint DOFs that are orthogonal to the selected DOF.
See the FEDEM Theory Guide, Section 6.5 "Joint Friction".</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Free</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all
joint DOFs to Free.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set All Fixed</td><td>Enables you to set the Constraint type of all
joint DOFs to Fixed.</td></tr>
