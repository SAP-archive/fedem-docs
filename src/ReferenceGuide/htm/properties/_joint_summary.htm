<tr><td>Constraint</td><td>This column shows the constraint type assigned to
each joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Load</td><td>This column shows the applied load in
each joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Model length</td><td>This column shows the modeled length/angle in
each joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Init disp.</td><td>This column shows the initial deflection in
each joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Length change</td><td>This column shows the function, if any,
that controls the change of length/angle of each joint DOF.
If the Constraint type is set to <i>Prescribed</i>, this change is enforced
directly on the joint DOF. However, if the Constraint type is set to
<i>Spring-Damper</i>, this function controls the Stress free length/angle change
of the associated joint DOF spring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Init vel.</td><td>This column shows the initial velocity applied to
each joint DOF.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spring</td><td>This column shows the spring characteristic assigned to
each joint DOF; either a numerical value defining a constant spring stiffness,
or a description of the spring characteristics used as a nonlinear stiffness-
or force-deflection relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spr. scale</td><td>This column shows the function that is used to scale
the force developed in the spring of each joint DOF.
Empty if no scaling.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Damper</td><td>This column shows the damper characteristic assigned to
each joint DOF; either a numerical value defining a constant damper coefficient,
or a description of a function used as a nonlinear coefficient- or
force-velocity relationship.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dmp. scale</td><td>This column shows the function that is used to scale
the force developed in the damper of each joint DOF.
Empty if no scaling.</td></tr>
