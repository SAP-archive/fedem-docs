<tr><td>Friction</td><td>Specifies the friction in the Cam joint.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Thickness / Width</td><td>Defines a rectangular domain in the xy-plane
of the local joint coordinate system, and is used to determine whether it is
necessary to test if the follower is in contact or not. The springs and dampers
associated with the joint DOFs are activated when the follower is located within
the distance <i>Thickness</i>/2 from the cam curve in the local x-direction, and
within the distance <i>Width</i>/2 in the local y-direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Use radial stiffness</td><td>Enables that the springs associated with
the x- and y joint DOFs are referred to local polar coordinates in the xy-plane.
The x-coordinate is then the radial distance from the Cam curve to the follower,
and the y-coordinate is the angle between the local Cartesian x-axis and the
axis extending from the contact point through the follower. The contact domain
will consequently be a circular cylinder instead of a rectangular one,
and the <i>Thickness</i> and <i>Width</i> parameters above will now define the
radial and the angular (in degrees) extension of the contact domain.
This can be used to simulate contact in pipes, etc.</td></tr>
