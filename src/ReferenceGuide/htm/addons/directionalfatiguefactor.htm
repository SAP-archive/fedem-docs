Directional Fatigue Factor (DFF)</h1>

<p>In the case when an analysis is done with unidirectional waves, but the true wave spectrum 
is distributed over many directions, the calculated life will be less than true life, because 
damage will be distributed over the pipe cross section.</p>

<p>A simplified approach to take this into account is to multiply the resulting fatigue with a 
directional factor (DFF) >1. This app calculates a DFF based on given directional distribution 
of waves. The calculation presumes the distribution of Hs to be the same for each direction.</p>

<p>Usage: You must have a set of probability values, representing the different directions. 
It does not matter how many. Type or paste the probability values in to the first column. 
The directional fatigue will be calculated according to the following rule:</p>

<p>where N is allowed number of stress cycles. Results are given for different values of m. 
The most conservative usage is to select the lowest m-value.</p>
