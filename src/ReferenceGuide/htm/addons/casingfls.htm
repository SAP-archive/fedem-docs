Casing FLS</h1>

<p>Casing FLS is used to calculate fatigue along a string of pipes in FEDEM, like 
for example a casing. The application can calculate single-run fatigue or 
statistical fatigue from several simulations made with the Multi-Event setup in 
FEDEM:</p>

<p>There are 3 steps involved with performing the analysis:</p>


<p><b>1. Generate a list of hotspots (HS) along the pipestring in the FEDEM model.</b></p>

<p>Specify the top triad of the pipestring and click the traverse button to perform the 
traversal. The application will try to connect to the running instance of FEDEM on your 
computer. Next, a list of hotspot will be generated for each endpoint of a pipe (beam 
element). If 2 joining endpoints have the same OD and ID, only one hotspot list item is 
created. If the dimensions differ, 2 separate hotspots are created, one for each pipe 
dimension.</p>


<p><b>2. Rainflow</b></p>

<p>The rainflow counting will find and store all stress ranges for each hotspot. 
The stress is nominal pipe stress on outer wall.</p>

<p><i>Gate value:</i> Stress ranges below this value, specified in units of Mpa, are not stored. 
This saves computational time and storage. The gate value should be selected so that 
omitting values below do no influence fatigue significantly.</p>

<p><i>Moment axis:</i> This refer to one of the 2 short axis of the pipe, local coordinate system. 
Multiaxial will calculate stress at several points around the circumference. Specify the 
number of discrete points to use.</p>

<p><i>Histogram:</i> Histogram data are more suited for visualization than rainflow counts. You can 
create an annual histogram of stress ranges (i.e. scaled to a 365 day period). Histogram 
data for all hotspots are listed in the output. If you do not fill in the "Max" field, then 
a max value will be calculated for each Hotspot. The max value will be rounded upwards to 
the nearest one digit whole number (e.g. 399 becomes 400). If you fill in the "Max" field, 
then this max value will be used for all Hotspots. Note: The histogram settings do not 
influence the damage calculations.</p>


<p><b>3. Damage</b></p>

<p>Damage calculation is done on basis of stress ranges from the rainflow counting, based on 
the settings in the parameter table.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The S-N curve standards available in the pull-down menu are defined in the file 
sn_curves.fsn located in the installation directory of Fedem. The syntax of the S-N curve 
definitions is description in the header of this file, and it is possible to add your own 
S-N curve definitions to that file.</p>


<p><b>Results listings:</b></p>

<p><i>Damage period:</i> The basic results are for the given time interval defined by Start time and 
Stop time. By selecting a different time frame, results are scaled accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Data to list:</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighted damage:</i> One line for each hotspot. One column for each line in the parameter list. 
Damage for all events is weighted with the event probability and summed up.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate damage for each event:</i> One line for each hotspot. One column for each event. 
Damage is not weighted with probability. The S-N and SCF used depend on the selected 
line in the parameter list.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage for each angle:</i> One line for each hotspot. One column for each angle. 
Weighted damage for all events. The S-N and SCF used depend on the selected line in the parameter list.</p>
