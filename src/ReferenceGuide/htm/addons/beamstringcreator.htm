Beam String Creator</h1>

<p>This tool is used to create beam strings as straight lines or in the shape of a catenary-curve. 
The catenary shape can include the effects of buoyancy, and tension caused by the shape can be included in the generated beam string.
</p>

<p>Please note that you must define cross sections in FEDEM before using this tool.</p>
<p>
A beam string contains one or more segments, with various dimensions and level of discretization/number of beam elements. <br>
Each segment corresponds to one row in the applications table. <br>
To add a segment you must select a cross section from the drop-down menu in the bottom row, specify the total length for your segment, and the length of the beams the segment should be made of.
</p>

<h2>Straight beam string</h2>
<p>The default mode for the Beam String Creator creates a straight beam string starting from the position specified in the <b>End 1</b> input box, 
shooting straight out in the direction specified by the vector in the <b>Direction</b> input box.<br>
</p>

<h2>Catenary Curve</h2>
<p>
When the <b>"Catenary Curve"</b> check-box is checked, the Beam String Creator will attempt to generate the beam string in a catenary shape, that is in the shape of a hanging chain.<br>
The <b>Direction</b> input box will now be gray, and a second end-point must instead be specified in the <b>End 2</b> input box. 
The beam string will "hang" between these two points as long as the distance between them is shorter than the cumulative length of the beam strings segments.<br>
If the application succeeds in finding a catenary shape, a plot of the beam string will be shown in the window below the segment-table.
</p>

<h3>Buoyancy</h3>
<p>If the <b>"Buoyancy"</b> check-box is checked, buoyancy effects will be included in the catenary calculation. <br>
The buoyancy calculation is based on the buoyancy diameter Db for each segments cross section, and a water density of 1025kg/m^3.
</p>

<h3>Tension</h3>
<p>When laid out in a catenary shape, the beam string will by default have no tension in this shape. The separate beams are simply rigidly connected to each other.<br>
With <b>"Tension"</b> toggled on, joints will be placed between each pair of beams, and rotational springs with tension corresponding to the angle between consecutive beams will be added.
Calculated tension is based on the E-modulus for each cross sections material, and the second moment of area for the cross section. Cross sections are assumed to be circular.<br> 

Note that the tension effect is not included in the calculation of the catenary shape, and will thus only be a reasonable approximation for beam strings with low stiffness. 
This means that the beam string is not in equilibrium in its initial state.
