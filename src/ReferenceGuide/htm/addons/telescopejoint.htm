Telescope Joint</h1>

<p>The Telescope Joint application is used to create a telescope joint, that is a cylindrical connection between two beam strings.<br>
The tool contains two separate ways to create such a joint:
</p>

<h2>Connect Beam strings</h2>
<p>
<b>"Connect Beam strings"</b> is used when you have an existing pair of beam strings in your model, with overlapping beams in the area you want to create a telescope joint.
</p>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>In FEDEM, select the beams to constitute the "upper barrel" of the telescope joint, by holding ctrl and picking the beams in either the 3D-view or object-tree. 
<li>Push the <b>"Get Selection"</b> button for the <b>"Upper Barrel"</b> list.
<li>Verify that the selected beams are listed with their base-IDs and description field.
<li>Repeat the above steps for the "lower barrel"
<li>Push the <b>"Generate Telescope joint"</b> button to create the cylindrical joint connection between the two barrels.
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Replace Beam</h2>
<p>
<b>"Replace Beam"</b> is used when you want to insert a telescope joint as a replacement for an existing beam in a beam string.
<p>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>In FEDEM, select the beam to replace either in the 3D-view or the object-tree. 
<li>Push the <b>"Get Selected beam"</b> button.
<li>Verify that the selected beam is shown with its base-ID, description and length.
<li>Specify the outer and inner diameter for both barrels, as well as their respective lengths.<br>
Note that each of these must be shorter than the length of the beam to replace.
<li>Push the <b>"Generate Telescope joint"</b> button to replace the beam with a telescope joint.
</ol>
