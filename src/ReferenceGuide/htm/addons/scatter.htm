Scatter</h1>

<p>The Scatter application is used to import and manage wave scatter diagrams 
for the FEDEM event system.</p>

<p>Blocking can be performed on the scatter data to reduce the number of low
probability events (i.e. unnecessary events) in the FEDEM model. A large number
of events will take a long time to simulate in FEDEM. By blocking out the low
probability events, you can reduce the number of events, and reduce the amount
of time needed by the FEDEM solvers.</p>


<h2>Paste from Excel</h2>

<p>You start by copying and pasting a scatter diagram from Excel (see example below):
<ul> 
<li>The top row must contain the Tp-values (midpoint values). 
<li>The left-most column must contain the Hs-values (midpoint values).
<li>The data must contain the probability values for each Hs-Tp combination.</ul></p>


<h2>Blocking methods</h2>

<p>The "auto-block" and "block selected" buttons (see below) use <i>blocking methods</i>
on a range of cells. The blocking methods start by calculating the weighted average, &lt;Hs&gt;, 
of the Hs values; and the weighted average, &lt;Tp&gt;, of the Tp values. The probability
values will be summed and moved to the (&lt;Hs&gt;,&lt;Tp&gt;) cell. Blocking is an effective
technique for reducing the number of low-probability events in the FEDEM model.<p>

<p>The weighted average, &lt;Hs&gt;, of the Hs values is calculated as follows 
(in order of increasing conservatism):
<ol>
<li><b>Straight average.</b> The weighted average of Hs is:<br>
<img src="../../img/addons/scatter-hs-avg1.png">
<li><b>Fifth power average.</b> The weighted average of Hs is:<br>
<img src="../../img/addons/scatter-hs-avg5.png">
<li><b>Maximum.</b> Uses the maximum Hs value in the block.
</ol></p>

<p>The weighted average, &lt;Tp&gt;, of the Tp values is always calculated as follows:<br>

<h2>Auto-block</h2>

<p>The Auto-block function merges cells within the same column, 
i.e. they have same Tp. 
The blocking method determines the target (&lt;Hs&gt;,&lt;Tp&gt;) cell.
The number of cells getting merged into one are limited by 
the following user settings:<br>
1. <i>Limit probability:</i> The max probability allowed for the resulting cell.<br>
2. <i>Max rows blocked:</i> The total number of rows that that are allowed merged.</p>


<h2>Block selected</h2>

<p>The selected range of cells are merged into one cell (within the selected range).
The blocking method determines the target (&lt;Hs&gt;,&lt;Tp&gt;) cell.</p>


<h2>Normalize</h2>

<p>The scatter diagram shows probabilities in percentage. 
Press Normalize in order to normalize the data so that the sum of 
probabilities becomes 100.</p>


<h2>Move cell</h2>

<p>Move cell will sum the contents of two selected cells and put the
sum in the left or bottom cell. The right or top cell will become blank.</p>


<h2>Generate events or output event file</h2>

<p>You can Generate Events directly in the currently open FEDEM model, 
or you can save events as an event input file for FEDEM.</p>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The figure below illustrates an example wave scatter diagram (in Microsoft Excel).
Here you can see that the first row (or header row) contains the Hs values 
(i.e. significant wave height [m]), and the left-most column (or header column)
contains the Tp values (i.e. peak period [s]). The data cells contain the probability
values (in percent) for each Hs-Tp combination. Empty cells have zero probability.</p>
