<h1><a name="_mainui_default"></a>The FEDEM User Interface</h1>

<p>The user interface of FEDEM consists of the following main parts:<ul>
<li><a href="graphics-modeller.htm">Graphics Modeller</a>: Displays an interactive 3D representation of the model.
<li><a href="object-tree.htm">Model Manager panel</a>: Displays the object tree structure of the model and results.
<li><a href="topology-view.htm">ID and Topology panel</a>: Displays ID and topology information for the selected object.
<li><a href="object-properties.htm">Property Editor panel</a>: Displays the properties of the selected object.
</ul></p>

<p>The recommended workflow for using the FEDEM software is as follows:
<ol>
<li><b>Planning.</b> It is important that you establish a clear and good plan before you start the modelling.
	A clear picture, at the advent of the project, model, solving, and analysis is important.
	This part of the project requires a certain level of skill and experience with using the FEDEM software.
	New users should consult an experienced FEDEM user, especially in more advanced projects.
	We also recommend that new users experiment by modelling, solving and analysing a few test models before continuing.
<li><b>Modelling.</b> This phase consists mainly of using the modelling constructs in FEDEM to create a realistic model.
	FEDEM offers a varity of low-level modelling constructs, such as Parts, Triads, Joints, etc., for detailed modelling,
	as well as more high-level constructs (depending on the licensing) for rapid creation and modification of complex models.
<li><b>Solve.</b> FEDEM offers a broad range of numerical solvers.
	The solvers basically process the model and produce result files.
	These result files must then be analysed.
<li><b>Analyse.</b> FEDEM offers powerful tools for analysing the numerical results.
	You can easily create Animations, Graphs, Curves, etc., and export data for external processing.
<li><b>Evaluate.</b> The analysis data must be evaluated by experts to make conclusions about the project.
</ol></p>

<p>The FEDEM software has been developed over well a decade and used on many large/highly complex projects over the time.
If there is a problem you wish to investiage but do not immediately see how you can solve it in FEDEM,
then we recommend that you explore the software and the documentation a bit further.
The chances for that it is possible to solve the problem somehow are in most cases good.</p>
