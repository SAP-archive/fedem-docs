<h1><a name="_mainui_topology-view"></a>ID and Topology panel</h1>

<p>When an object in the model is selected, the ID and Topology panel displays
information related to the object as described below. If multiple items are
selected, only the item selected last is displayed.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/topology1.png" width="273" height="199"></p>

<p><ol>
<li><i>Item Type</i> – the type of the selected object
	(for example, Revolute joint, Gear, or Spring).
<li><i>ID Number</i> – a unique integer that distinguishes
	one item of the same type from another.
<li><i>Topology View</i> – a list that displays the mechanism objects
	related or connected to the selected item.
</ol></p>

<p>ID numbers are assigned automatically to new objects in increasing numerical order.
If you delete an object, such as a Ball joint with ID 3, this number is <i>not</i>
reused although it now is free, when/if a new Ball joint is created later in the same model.</p>

<h2>Topology view and browsing</h2>

<p>Most mechanism components are related to other objects; for example,
joints consists of triads that are connected to parts, and sensors are
measuring variables from other mechanism components.</p>

<p>These relations are shown by the Topology view in a hierarchical fashion,
indicating their topological relationships. This list can then be used to
investigate these related objects, and to browse through the mechanism model
through the topological connections. This can be done by using the browsing
features offered by the Topology View described below.

<p>Temporary highlight: The items in the topology view will be highlighted in
the Modeler when you select an item keeping the mouse button pressed. This is
useful to see exactly which objects in the 3D view that corresponds to the
listed item.</p>

<p>Right clicking an item in the list will show a tiny pop-up menu that allows
you to either Zoom to or Select the item.</p>

<p>Zoom To: This command zooms to the item, making it easy to locate it in a complex model.</p>

<p>Select: This command will select the right clicked object from the topology
view, and thus jump to it showing the properties of that item instead.
Double clicking an item in the Topology view will also select it.</p>

<p>Select All: This command will select all objects from the topology view,
but showing the properties of the last object only. The effect of this command
is the same as doing a multi-selection from the Objects list view of Model Manager.</p>
