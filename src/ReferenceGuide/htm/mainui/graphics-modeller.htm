<h1><a name="_mainui_graphics-modeller"></a>Graphics Modeller</h1>

<p>The Graphics Modeller is used to interactively view, select and modify objects.</p>

<p>You can navigate the 3D model view with the following main operations:<p>

<p><table border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#dbe5f1"><td><b>Operation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td><td><b>Description:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Pan view</td><td>Press and hold the F1 key on the keyboard, while moving the mouse
	over the view to pan the view in the x/y-plane of the view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zoom view</td><td>Press and hold the F2 key on the keyboard, while moving the mouse
	over the view to zoom the view along the z-axis of the view. You can alternatively roll
	the middle mouse button to zoom as well. The Z-key will also zoom the view.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rotate view</td><td>Press and hold the middle mouse button. If you do this on the
	center part of the view, it will rotate the view around the x- and y-axis of the view.
	If you do this at the edge of the view, it will rotate around the z-axis of the view.
	You can alternatively press and hold the F3 key (instead of the middle mouse button).
	Further, you can also rotate the view by using the arrow keys, in combinaton with the
	Alt key for rotation around the z-axis.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Center on object</td><td>Press and hold F4 while clicking on an object to select
	and zoom to that object. This will set the rotation center for the view.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h2>Snapping</h2>
<p>When selecting objects in your model, the selection automatically snaps to a point on
the object such as the nearest node on an FE part, the center point of a joint, and so on.
This makes your selection quick and accurate.</p>

<h2>Multiple selection</h2>
<p>Some FEDEM commands, such as Smart Move and Delete, allow you to select several items
at once. To select more than one item, press and hold down the Ctrl key and then click
the items you want to add to your selection.</p>

<h2>Selection history</h2>
<p>FEDEM maintains a history of the items you select in the current session. This history
can be accessed using the Select Backward and Select Forward commands.</p>

<h2>Co-located items</h2>
<p>Sometimes several items in a model are located very close together or on top of each
other; in FEDEM, these are called co-located items. To select a co-located item, click
the same spot several times to cycle through the items. FEDEM cycles from the item closest
to the viewer to the one furthest from the viewer.</p>
