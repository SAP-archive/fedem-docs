<h1><a name="_mainui_object-tree"></a>Model Manager</h1>

<p>The Model Manager panel contains lists of all objects and result views that make up your model.
This includes mechanism and control system objects, along with animations and graphs.
In each list, the objects are grouped by type and sorted by identification numbers or names.
Right-click menus can access several commands that can be applied on the selected objects.</p>

<p>You select objects by clicking them. You can also hold down the shift key while
clicking to select multiple objects. The properties of the objects are shown in the
<a href="object-properties.htm">Property Editor</a> panel when they are selected.</p>

<p><table border="1" bgcolor="#ffffe0"><tr><td>
<b>Important:</b> Be careful when modifying the object properties when multiple items are selected.
FEDEM will then assign the displayed property values to all selected items.
</td></tr></table></p>

<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>The Objects tab displays a list of all modeling objects in your model.
Selecting an item from this list highlights its graphic representation in the Graphics Modeler
(or Control System Editor) and displays its properties in the Property Editor panel.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The Results tab displays a list of the result views you have created.
The available result view types are Graphs which contains Curves
(individual sets of plotted data), and Animations.</p>

<p>Selecting a Graph from this list will cause the window plotting it to
pop up, if loaded. Selecting a Curve will highlight it (the curve is rendered red)
and raise the Graph view in which it resides to the front as well.</p>

<p>See the chapter on "Postprocessing Results" in the User's Guide,
for more information about graphed and animated results.</p>
