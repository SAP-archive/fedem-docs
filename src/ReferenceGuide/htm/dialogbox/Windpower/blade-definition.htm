<h1><a name="_dialogbox_blade-definition"></a>Blade Definition</h1>

<p>The Blade Definition dialog box is used to define the wind turbine blades.
The FEDEM WindPower package includes some example blades (e.g., the "Sample 5MW Blade").
If the blades of the turbine are not the main focus area for your simulation, you can simply
specify one of the example blades in the <a href="turbine-definition.htm">Turbine definition</a> dialog box.
Many projects will, however, require the blades to be defined in detail before the simulation is conducted.</p>

<p>The Blade Definition dialog box consists of the following four main parts:<ul>
<li><b><i>Blade visualization</i></b> -
The area at the top of the dialog displays the blade segments (length and chord) on the left side,
and a drawing of the cross section for the selected blade segment on the right side.
<li><b><i>Blades</i></b> -
Beneath the blade visualization, the drop list <i>Blades</i> is located showing the available blade designs.
Just click on a file name to display its properties in the visualization area and in the data table.
Blades that are included with the FEDEM WindPower installation are not editable, as indicated by the lock symbol.
To the far right, use the green <b>+</b> button to browse for new blade design libraries,
and the red <b>-</b> button to remove a selected folder from the Blades list.
<li><b><i>Description</i></b> - Use this field to assign a name to the blade.
You can add and remove blade segments by clicking the <i>Add Segment</i> and <i>Remove Segment</i> buttons.
The <i>New Blade</i> button can be used to create a new (initially empty) blade design.
<li><b><i>Data table</i></b> -
The table in the lower part of the dialog contains the aerodynamic and structural properties of the blade design.
The columns correspond to the blade segments making up the entire blade, from the blade root to the tip.
Click one of the columns to display a drawing of the cross section of that segment in the upper right area.
</ul></p>

<h2>Aerodynamic properties</h2>

<p><img src="../../../img/dlg-blade-definition-3.png" width="508" height="364"></p>

<p>The figure above shows the Blade Definition dialog box when it displays the
Aerodynamic properties in the data table. It consists of the following rows:<ul>
<li><i>Segment length [m]</i> - Length of the blade segment along the pitch of the blade).
<li><i>Chord length [m]</i> - Width of the blade segment (perpendicular to the length direction).
<li><i>Aerodynamic twist angle [deg]</i> - Twist of the blade (&alpha; in the figure below)
relative to the rotor plane.
<li><i>Pitch center parallel</i> - Location of the pitch center (a in the figure below)
along the chord line, given as a fraction of the chord length.
This value is typically between 0 and 1, but can be negative if the center is located
in front of the leading edge, and larger than one if it is located behind the trailing edge.
<li><i>Pitch center normal</i> - Offset of the pitch center (b in the figure below)
in the normal direction of the chord line, given as a fraction of the chord length.
<li><i>Aero center parallel</i> - Location of the aero center (c in the figure below)
along the chord line, relative to the leading edge and given as a fraction of the chord length.
<li><i>Airfoil type</i> - File name of the airfoil data of this blade segment.
If you click on the file name a browse button [...] appears besides it,
and by clicking that one you can browse for another airfoil file.
The contents of the airfoil files can be viewed and edited using the
<a href="airfoil-definition.htm">Airfoil Definition</a> dialog box.
<li><i>Thickness ratio</i> - Thickness of the blade relative to the chord length.
This value does not affect the aerodynamic load calculations.
It is only used to estimate the circumference of the cross section when
calculating the weight of ice on the turbine blades.
In addition, it is used to to create the cross section drawing in the upper right part of the dialog box.
</ul></p>

<h2>Structural properties</h2>

<p>The figure below shows the Blade Definition dialog box when it displays the
Structural properties of the blade segments in the data table.
In addition, the <i>Blades</i> area has been contracted here,
to show only the path of the currently selected blade design.
It can be expanded again to show all available blade designs,
by clicking the black triangle to the right of the file path.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/dlg-blade-definition-4.png" width="511" height="367"></p>

<p>The structural property table consists of the following rows:<ul>
<li><i>Elastic center parallel</i> - Location of the elastic center, or neutral axis
(e in the figure below) along the chord line, given as a fraction of the chord length.
This value is typically between 0 and 1, but can be negative if
the center is located in front of the leading edge,
and larger than one if it is located behind the trailing edge.
<li><i>Elastic center normal</i> - Offset of the elastic center
(f in the figure below) in the normal direction, given as a fraction of the chord length.
<li><i>Elastic axes relative rotation [deg]</i> - Angle (in degrees) between the
chord line and the local y-axis of the structural beam element, for which the flapwise
bending stiffness is referring to. The edgewise bending stiffness is then referring
to the local z-axis, defined via the cross product of the length axis of the beam and the local y-axis.
<li><i>Mass center offset-x, parallel</i> - Offset of the mass center from the elastic center,
along the rotated elastic x-axis, given as a fraction of the chord length.
<li><i>Mass center offset-y, normal</i> - Offset of the mass center from the elastic center,
along the rotated elastic y-axis, given as a fraction of the chord length.
<li><i>Mass per unit length [kg/m]</i> - Mass density of this blade segment.
Only nominal structural mass should be given here. Mass from ice and other effects
can be set on the <a href="../../properties/Windpower/blade.htm">Blade</a> object.
<li><i>Torsional inertia per unit length [kg]</i> - Torsional inertia of this blade segment.
<li><i>Bending stiffness, flapwise [Nm<sup>2</sup>]</i> - Bending stiffness <i>EI<sub>yy</sub></i>,
with respect to local elastic axes.
<li><i>Bending stiffness, edgewise [Nm<sup>2</sup>]</i> - Bending stiffness <i>EI<sub>zz</sub></i>,
with respect to local elastic axes.
<li><i>Torsion stiffness [Nm<sup>2</sup>]</i> - Torsional stiffness <i>GI<sub>t</sub></i>.
<li><i>Axial stiffness [N]</i> - Axial stiffness, <i>EA</i>.
<li><i>Shear stiffness, flapwise [N]</i> - Shear stiffnesses <i>GA<sub>sy</sub></i>,
with respect to local elastic axes.
<li><i>Shear stiffness, edgewise [N]</i> - Shear stiffnesses <i>GA<sub>sz</sub></i>,
with respect to local elastic axes.
<li><i>Shear center, parallel</i> - Offset of the shear center from the elastic center,
along the rotated elastic y-axis, given as fractions of the chord length.
<li><i>Shear center, normal</i> - Offset of the shear center from the elastic center,
along the rotated elastic z-axis, given as fractions of the chord length.
