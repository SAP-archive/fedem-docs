<h1><a name="_dialogbox_turbine-definition"></a>Turbine Definition</h1>

<p>The Turbine Definition dialog box allows you to easily create a working wind
turbine model from a set of basic parameters.
A new model can be created the first time the dialog is used.
Thereafter, the dialog can be used to modify the turbine model.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/dlg-turbine-definition.png" width="584" height="455"></p>

<p>The various fields in the Turbine Definition dialog box are as follows:<ul>

<li><i>Tower base</i>
- This field group specifies the tower base position and tower height:<br>
<i>X, Y, Z</i> - Global position of the bottom of the tower.<br>
<i>T</i> - Height of the tower.

<li><i>Driveline</i>
- This field group specifies the location and size of various items
inside the turbine nacelle:<br>
<i>D1</i> - Distance from the tower top to the main shaft.<br>
<i>D2</i> - Distance from the tower top to the hub flange.<br>
<i>D3</i> - Distance from gearbox to the hub flange.
This also equals the length of the main shaft.<br>
<i>D4</i> - Depth of the gearbox.<br>
<i>D5</i> - Length of the secondary shaft.<br>
<i>D6</i> - Depth of the generator.<br>
<i>B1</i> - Distance from the hub flange to the first bearing.<br>
<i>B2</i> - Distance between the two bearings.<br>
<i>S</i> - Offset distance between the shaft axes.<br>
<i>&Theta;</i> - Offset angle of the secondary shaft.

<li><i>Hub</i>
- This field group specifies the positions and angles of the hub:<br>
<i>H1</i> - Distance from the hub flange to the hub apex.<br>
<i>Hr</i> - Hub radius.<br>
<i>&alpha;</i> - Uptilt angle of the main shaft.<br>
<i>&beta;</i> - Precone angle of the blades.

<li><i>Nacelle</i>
- This field group provides information about the nacelle:<br>
<i>CogX, CogY, CogZ</i> - Center of gravity for the nacelle.
Note that this only applies to the nacelle Part itself,
which primarily is the support structures
and not other elements of the driveline which also reside inside the nacelle.
The mass value can be set in the property field for the nacelle Part
after the turbine are generated.

<li><i>Blade design</i> - Specifies the blade design to use.
A set of sample blades is included in the FEDEM WindPower software package.
They are stored as separate model files and can be selected using the browse
button [...] just to the right of the Blade design field.
You can also make your own blade designs by using the
<a href="blade-definition.htm">Blade Definition</a> dialog box.
The Blade design field will appear with a <i>pink</i> color as long as
no valid path to a blade design file has been specified.
It will turn <i>yellow</i> once a valid path is selected.
A <i>green</i> field means that this blade design is now included in the model,
and copies of the blade and its airfoil files are now located in the blade
folder of the current model.

<li><i>Number of blades</i> - Specifies the number of blades for the turbine.

<li><i>Include control system</i> - Includes a
<a href="../../properties/Windpower/controller.htm">control system</a>
for regulating the pitch and torque behaviour of the turbine.
</ul></p>

<p>The <i>Generate turbine</i> button will generate a mechanism assembly
of the defined turbine, consisting of Beam elements, Triads, Joints, etc.
However, if turbine a model already has been created, the same button is
labelled <i>Update turbine</i> and the positions and properties of the existing
turbine components are then updated according the the field values.
The genereated wind turbine model is contained in a Turbine object
that will appear in the Objects browser of the Model Manager panel.
The turbine object again consists of severel sub-objects for the logical parts
of the turbine, such as Tower, Nacelle, Rotor, etc.
Each of these sub-objects (which may also contain other sub-objects) then
contain the basis objects (Beams, Triads, Joints, etc.) making up the turbine
assembly.</p>

<p>If a turbine model already exists, some of the fields in the
Turbine Definition dialog cannot be changed and are therefore disabled (gray).
These are <i>Driveline type</i>, <i>Bearings</i> and <i>Number of blades</i>.
You must delete the existing model before any of these fields can be changed.
</p>

<p>The Turbine Definition dialog also provides <i>Copy data</i> and
<i>Paste data</i> buttons to simplify the process of experimenting with
many different turbine designs. Click the <i>Copy data</i> button
to copy all field values of the dialog to the clipboard.
You can paste the data back into the dialog box by clicking <i>Paste data</i>,
or paste the data into a text editor or other applications.
The paste operation will not affect the disabled fields.</p>
