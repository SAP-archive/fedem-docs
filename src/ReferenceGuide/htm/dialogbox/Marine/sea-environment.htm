<h1><a name="_dialogbox_sea-environment"></a>Sea Environment</h1>

<p>The Sea Environment dialog is accessed from the <i>Marine</i> pull down menu
in the main window. It is used to specify the global sea environment properties
that are used in the calculation of Hydrodynamic loads on the FEDEM mechanism.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/sea-environment.png" width="318" height="351"></p>

<p>The data fields of the Sea Environment dialog box are as follows:<ul>
<li><i>Water density</i> - Specifies the mass density of the sea water.
<li><i>Mean sea level</i> - Specifies the mean sea water level (MSL).
That is, the distance from the global origin to the sea surface at calm sea,
in the opposite direction of the gravitation vector.
<li><i>Water depth</i> - Specifies the water depth.
That is, the distance from the calm sea surface to the sea bed,
in the direction of the gravitation vector. This value affects how the water
particle velocity and acceleration decays exponentially from the sea surface.
A zero or negative value signals an infinite water depth formulation.
<li><i>Gravitation</i> - Specifies the gravity vector.
Its direction also defines the inward normal vector of the calm sea surface.
<li><i>Wave direction</i> - Specifies the global wave propagation direction.
This vector is used to construct the reference coordinate system that is
used for the wave kinematics calculations.
See <a href="#_wave-coordinate-system">Wave coordinate system</a> below.
<li><i>Marine growth</i> - Specifies properties that are used to calculate
additional mass due to marine growth on submerged structures.
<li><i>Wave function</i> - Specifies a function of type
<a href="../../properties/Marine/wave-function.htm">Wave Function</a>
that describes the sea surface elevation (above the specified mean sea level) and the water particle motion.
<li><i>Current function</i> - Specifies a function of type
<a href="../../properties/Marine/current-function.htm">Current Function</a>
that describes the current magnitude (i.e., the non-periodic water particle velocity).
<li><i>Current direction</i> - Specifies a function of type
<a href="../../properties/Marine/current-function.htm">Current Function</a>
that defines the angle (in radians) between the wave propagation direction
and the current direction.
<li><i>Current scale</i> - Specifies an optional scaling of the current magnitude.
Any defined general <a href="../../properties/function.htm">Function</a>
can be specified here.
<li><i>Hydrodynamic force scale</i> - Specifies an optional scaling of the computed
hydrodynamic forces. Any defined general
<a href="../../properties/function.htm">Function</a> can be given here.
This can be used to, e.g., ramp up the hydrodynamic forces in the beginning
of a simulation with a sensitive structure.
</ul>

NOTE: The gravity vector may also be defined in the
<a href="../model-preferences.htm">Model Preferences</a> dialog.
If the gravity vector is changed in that dialog, it will automatically be updated
in the Sea environment dialog also, and vice versa.</p>

<h3><a name="_wave-coordinate-system"></a>Wave coordinate system</h3>

<p>The wave kinematics (i.e., water particle velocities and accelerations)
is defined through the specified Wave and Current functions in the
Sea Environment dialog described above. These are spatial functions
referring to a coordinate system which is defined as follows:
<ul>
<li>Its origin is the projection of the global origin along the gravity vector onto the MSL surface.
<li>Its local Z-axis coincides with the normal vector (<b>n</b>) of the MSL surface,
which is defined from the gravity vector (<b>g</b>) through <b>n</b> = -<b>g</b>/|<b>g</b>|.
<li>Its local X-axis is the projection of the specified Wave direction vector
onto the MSL surface, unless an RAO is used. In the latter case,
the local X-axis of the Vessel Triad in the initial configuration is instead
projected onto the MSL surface. This projected vector is then rotated the selected
Wave direction angle about the local Z-axis to become the resulting local X-axis.
<li>Its local Y-axis is the cross product of the local Z- and X-axes.
</ul>

<p>Notice that the Z-coordinate of the wave coordinate system is negative
downwards towards the sea bed, starting from zero at the MSL. Therefore, the
<a href="../../properties/Marine/current-function.htm">Current Function</a>s
needs to be defined for negative argument values only.</p>
