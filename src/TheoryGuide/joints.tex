\section{Master and Slave based Joint Modeling}

A joint is a way of specifying a constrained relative motion between two bodies
or links in a mechanism.
In the finite element modeling of mechanism joints, superelement nodes are used
to specify the joint constraints.
A joint between two moving links, denoted 1 and 2, will in general be defined by
one node on link 1, called the slave triad, and one or more nodes on link 2,
called the master triad(s).
The constraints are then modeled by making all DOFs of the slave triad
dependent on all DOFs of the master triad(s), and DOFs of the joint itself.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Single-master Joints}

The position of the slave triad relative to the master triad is given by
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}{\mf P}_N\cdots{\mf P}_1{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:JointDef}
\end{equation}
%
where the interpretation of each term is as follows:
%
\begin{namelist}{${\mf P}_{MG}$}

\item[${\mf P}_{SG}$]
Position of Slave triad measured in the Global coordinate system.
The position is ultimately a function of the DOFs of the master triad
and the joint DOFs.

\item[${\mf P}_{MG}$]
Position of Master triad measured in the Global coordinate system.
This matrix is a function of the master triad DOFs and is thus
subject to variation.

\item[${\mf P}_{JT}$]
Position of the Joint measured in the master Triad coordinate system.
This matrix handles a possible offset of the joint relative to the master triad,
as well as joint orientation possibly different from that of the master triad.
The matrix is constant (carries no DOFs) and is thus not subject to variation.

\item[${\mf P}_i$]
Joint variable matrices, numbered from 1 to $N$.
Each matrix can have from 1 to 6 DOFs, or joint variables
(three translations and three rotations).
When all joint variables are zero, each of the matrices ${\mf P}_i$
becomes unity, and \eqnref{eq:JointDef} simplifies to
${\mf P}_{SG} = {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}{\mf P}_{SJ}$.

\item[${\mf P}_{SJ}$]
Position of the Slave triad measured in the Joint coordinate system,
when all joint variables are zero.
This matrix handles a possible offset of the joint relative to the slave triad,
as well as joint orientation possibly different from that of the slave triad.
This matrix is also constant, and is thus not subject to variation.

\end{namelist}
%
Note that the position of the joint itself, in the global system, is given by
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{JG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
\label{eq:JointPosGlobSingleMaster}
\end{equation}

The $N$ joint variable matrices ${\mf P}_i$ can be thought of as describing the
relative motion between $N+1$ bodies.
With one single joint variable matrix the two bodies will be the master- and
slave link, respectively (slave link as body 1, and master link as body 2).
With two or more joint variable matrices the intermediate bodies are of course
purely fictitious, although a very useful mental concept.
The joint variables associated with joint variable matrix ${\mf P}_i$ are
expressed in the coordinate system of body $i+1$.
According to~\eqref{eq:JointDef}, this gives the following coordinate system,
$\delta\tilde{\mf u}_1 = {\mf 0}$, for these joint variables:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf R}_{C_i} =\; {\mf R}_{MG}{\mf R}_{JT}{\mf R}_N\cdots{\mf R}_{i+1}
\quad\text{and}\quad
{\mf R}_{C_N} =\; {\mf R}_{MG}{\mf R}_{JT}
\label{eq:JVarCoordSys}
\end{equation}

Variation of \eqnref{eq:JointDef} provides an expression for the slave DOFs
as a linear combination of the free master DOFs, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:JointVar}
\eqalign{\delta{\mf P}_{SG} \;
= \;& \delta{\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}{\mf P}_N\cdots{\mf P}_1{\mf P}_{SJ} \cr
+ \;& {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}\delta{\mf P}_N\cdots{\mf P}_1{\mf P}_{SJ} \cr
\vdots \;& \cr
+ \;& {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}{\mf P}_N\cdots\delta{\mf P}_1{\mf P}_{SJ} }
\end{equation}
%
since $\delta{\mf P}_{JT}={\mf 0}$ and $\delta{\mf P}_{SJ}={\mf 0}$
according to the definitions above.

The first term of \eqnref{eq:JointVar} provides a linear coupling to the master
triad DOFs, and can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta{\mf u}_s \\
\delta{\tf \omega}_s
\end{array}\right]_M
\;=\;
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf I} & {\mf \widehat e}_{SM} \\
{\mf 0} & {\mf I}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta{\mf u}_m \\
\delta{\tf \omega}_m
\end{array}\right]
\label{eq:SingleMasterVariation}
\end{equation}
%
where ${\mf e}_{SM}$ is the position of the slave triad relative to the master
triad, measured in global system.
For simplicity, it is here assumed that both the master and slave triad have
DOFs in global directions.

The variation with respect to the joint variables of a given joint variable
matrix ${\mf P}_i$, can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:JVarVariation}
\eqalign{
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta{\mf u}_s \\
\delta{\tf \omega}_s
\end{array}\right]_i
=\; &
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf I} & {\mf \widehat e}_{Si} \\
{\mf 0} & {\mf I}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf R}_{C_i} & {\mf 0} \\
{\mf 0}       & {\mf R}_{C_i}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf 0} & {\mf 0} \\
{\mf 0} & {\mf H}_i
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta\tilde{\mf u}_i \\
\delta\tilde{\tf \theta}_i
\end{array}\right] \cr
=\; &
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf R}_{C_i} & {\mf \widehat e}_{Si}{\mf R}_{C_i}{\mf H}_i \\
{\mf 0}       & {\mf R}_{C_i}{\mf H}_i
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta\tilde{\mf u}_i \\
\delta\tilde{\tf \theta}_i
\end{array}\right] }
\end{equation}
%
where ${\mf e}_{Si}$ is the position of the slave triad relative to body $i+1$,
measured in global system.
The matrix ${\mf R}_{C_i}$ defines the coordinate system of joint variable
matrix $i$ according to \eqnref{eq:JVarCoordSys}.
The rotation gradient matrix
${\mf H} = \frac{\partial\tf\omega}{\partial\tf\theta}$
is given by \eqnref{eq:DomegaDtheta}.
Note that in case of only one rotational DOF for joint variable matrix
${\mf P}_i$, this simplifies (in effect) to ${\mf H}_i = {\mf I}$.


\subsection{Revolute Joint}

A revolute joint is modeled from two supernodes located on different links in a
mechanism, see Figure~\ref{fig:RevJoint}.

}
\caption{Coordinate axis and variable of revolute joint.}
\label{fig:RevJoint}
\end{figure}
%
The joint position matrix ${\mf P}_{JT}$ orients the joint coordinate system
to have local $z$-axis along the axis of relative rotation.
The joint has one joint variable matrix with a single DOF, $\tilde\theta_z$:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:RevJointDefault}
\end{equation}
%
Optionally, the joint may also have free motion in the $z$-direction,
in which case it has the additional DOF $\tilde w$:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_1(\tilde w,\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:RevJointFreeZ}
\end{equation}

The joint produces six constraint equations, one for each slave triad DOF.
Variation of the default revolute joint, \eqnref{eq:RevJointDefault},
will be that of \eqsref{eq:SingleMasterVariation}{eq:JVarVariation}
with the simplifications ${\mf H}_1 = \mf I$, $\delta\tilde{\mf u}_1 = {\mf 0}$,
and $\delta\tilde{\tf\theta}_1 = [0\;0\;\delta\tilde\theta_z]^T$.
With the additional freedom in $z$ as in \eqnref{eq:RevJointFreeZ},
the only change is $\delta\tilde{\mf u}_1 = [0\;0\;\delta\tilde{w}]^T$.


\subsection{Universal Joint}

A universal joint consists of three bodies:
Input Shaft, Center Cross, and Output Shaft.
It is thus modeled with two joint variable matrices to describe the relative
motion between the three bodies (the center cross body is only implicitly
defined through the joint formulation):
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:UniversalJointDef}
\end{equation}
%
The matrix ${\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_z)$ here describes the relative motion
(rotation) between the master body and the center cross.
The rotation axis is the $z$-axis of the joint coordinate system.
The matrix ${\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_y)$ describes the rotation between the
center cross an the slave body.
The rotation axis is here the $y$-axis of the cross coordinate system.
The $y$-axis of the cross coordinate system is initially coincident with
the $y$-axis of the joint coordinate system.
The joint coordinate system will normally be that of the master triad.


\subsection{Constant Velocity Joint}

A constant velocity joint is modeled using the fact that two universal joints
connected via an intermediate shaft will give a constant rotational velocity,
provided that each joint absorbs half of the total angle between the input and
output shaft.
This gives a joint formulation with 4 joint variable matrices,
and two constraint equations that ensure the equal shaft-axis angle between the
two fictitious universal joints:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_4(\tilde{\theta}_{z_4})
{\mf P}_3(\tilde{\theta}_{y_3})
{\mf P}_2(\tilde{\theta}_{y_2})
{\mf P}_1(\tilde{\theta}_{z_1})
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:CVJointDef}
\end{equation}
%
with the additional linear constraint equations
%
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\theta}_{z_4} = \tilde{\theta}_{z_1} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad
\tilde{\theta}_{y_3} = \tilde{\theta}_{y_2}
\label{eq:CVJointHP}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Ball Joint}

A ball joint is modeled from two supernodes located on different
links in a mechanism, see Figure~\ref{fig:BallJoint}.
The default ball joint formulation has Euler angles $Z-Y-X$ as joint DOFs:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_3(\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:BallJoint1}
\end{equation}
%
In addition, the ball joint is available with components of the rotation
axis as joint DOFs:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_z,\tilde\theta_y,\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:BallJoint2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[b]
\center\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{Figures/ballJoint.png}
\caption{Coordinate system i and j of a ball joint}
\label{fig:BallJoint}
\end{figure}

The formulation with the rotation axis parameterization may be used if the
default formulation runs into singularities with respect to the Euler angles.
If singularity arises for the Euler angles, one may also try rotating the joint
(different initial orientation).


\subsection{Rigid Joint}

A rigid joint (see Figure~\ref{fig:RigidJoint}) contains no joint variable
matrices since there is no relative motion between the master and slave bodies.
The joint allows a rigid coupling between two nodes that need not be coincident,
nor is there a limitation on common directions in space:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:RigidJointDef}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[t]
\center\includegraphics[width=3.9in]{Figures/rigidJoint.png}
\caption{Coordinate axis of rigid joint.}
\label{fig:RigidJoint}
\end{figure}

The rigid joint is often used for accessing internal forces through the
joint at system level during simulation.


\subsection{Free Joint}
\label{subs:Free Joint}

The free joint (see Figure~\ref{fig:FreeJoint}) is modeled from two supernodes
located on ground or different links in a mechanism.
There is full freedom of motion between the links,
provided by six joint variables.
The three translational joint variables are in the coordinate system of the
joint itself, and the three rotational joint variables are Euler angles $Z-Y-X$.
This gives the joint formulation as
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_3(\tilde u,\tilde v,\tilde w,\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:FreeJoint}
\end{equation}
%
The free joint is also available with components of the rotation
axis as joint DOFs:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_1(\tilde u,\tilde v,\tilde w,\tilde\theta_z,\tilde\theta_y,\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:FreeJoint2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[t]
\center\includegraphics[width=3.55in]{Figures/freeJoint.png}
\caption{Coordinate system i and j for a free joint.}
\label{fig:FreeJoint}
\end{figure}

The reason for having this joint is to facilitate introduction of constraints,
prescribed motions and spring/damper properties on the DOFs represented by the
joint variables rather than the global triad DOFs.
Note that an entirely spring-based free joint formulation, without the joint
variable transformations given by \eqsref{eq:FreeJoint}{eq:FreeJoint2},
also is available for this joint type, see Section~\ref{subs:Global spring}.


\subsection{Axial Joint}

An axial joint is modeled from two supernodes located on two different links.
The joint position matrix ${\mf P}_{JT}$ orients the joint coordinate system
to have its local $x$-axis pointing from the master triad to the slave triad.
The joint has one joint variable matrix with a single DOF, $\tilde u$,
the displacement along the local $x$-axis:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{MG}{\mf P}_{JT}
{\mf P}_1(\tilde u)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\end{equation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Multi-master Joints}

The multi-master joints have the same formulation with respect to the relative
motion between the joint itself and the slave triad, as single-master joints.
These joints have an additional variable, called the slider variable $s$,
which expresses the position of the joint (or follower) along a curve defined
by $N$ master triads, i.e, ${\mf P}_{JG}(s)$.
For each master triad, the joint position relative to the triad itself is
defined through ${\mf P}_{JT_i}$, such that the path the follower is to travel
along does not need to go through the triads themselves.
This can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{JG} \:=\; {\mf P}(s,{\mf P}_{JG_1},\cdots,{\mf P}_{JG_N})
\quad\text{where}\quad{\mf P}_{JG_i} = {\mf P}_{MG_i}{\mf P}_{JT_i}
\label{eq:FollowerFunction}
\end{equation}
%
which resembles the similar expression for the single master joint in
\eqnref{eq:JointPosGlobSingleMaster}.

The variation of \eqnref{eq:FollowerFunction} with respect to the $N$
master triads is
%
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta{\mf u}_s \\
\delta{\tf \omega}_s
\end{array}\right]_M
\;=\; \sum_{i=1}^N f(s)_i
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
{\mf I} & {\mf \widehat e}_{SM_i} \\
{\mf 0} & {\mf I}
\end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta{\mf u}_{m_i} \\
\delta{\tf \omega}_{m_i}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}
%
which closely resembles the similar expression for the single master joints,
\eqnref{eq:SingleMasterVariation}.
If the follower is positioned between node $k$ and $l$,
the interpolation functions $f(s)_i$ will be
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MultimasterWeight}
\eqalign{
f(s)_k \;=\;& (-s-s_l)/(s_l -s_k) \cr
f(s)_l \;=\;& ( s-s_k)/(s_l -s_k) \cr
f(s)_i \;=\;& 0 \quad\mbox{for}\;\; i\ne k \;\;\mbox{and}\;\; i\ne l
}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Prismatic Joint}

The prismatic joint is modeled from three or more supernodes where one node,
the slave triad, is located on the first link while two or more nodes,
the master triads, are located on the second link.
The master triads define a straight line along which the sliding occur,
see Figure~\ref{fig:PrismJoint}.
The slave link can rotate about the $x$- and $y$-axes of the joint,
which gives the following parameterization:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:PrismDef}
\end{equation}
%
The $z$-axis of the joint is always pointing in the positive curve direction.

\begin{figure}[b]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/prismaticJoint.png}
\caption{Prismatic joint with slave and master nodes.}
\label{fig:PrismJoint}
\end{figure}

To model telescopic motion, two parallel prismatic joints of this type is used
between the same two links of the mechanism.


\subsection{Cylindric Joint}

The cylindric joint closely resembles the prismatic joint, but the slave link
is also free to rotate about the master line itself.
The joint coordinate system has, as for the prismatic joint, the local $z$-axis
along the master curve in positive direction, which gives the parameterization:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_3(\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:CylindricDef}
\end{equation}
%
The rotation can also be parameterized using rotation axis components:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_z,\tilde\theta_y,\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:CylindricDef2}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Cam Joint}
\label{subs:Cam Joint}

The cam surface is defined by a curve through an ordered set of master triads.
If the first and last master are identical, the cam has a closed surface.
The curve tangent defines the local $z$-axis of the joint coordinate system.
Its local $x$-axis corresponds with the surface normal direction, and is defined
from the local $x$-axis direction of the master triads along the curve.

Currently, the curve defining the cam surface can consist of straight lines
and circle arcs only, each made up of three nodes, see Figure~\ref{fig:Cam}.
A straight line is simply an arc with zero curvature ($1/R\approx0$).

\begin{figure}[t]
\center\includegraphics[width=2.2in]{Figures/CamCurve.png}
\caption{Cam curve composed of a circle arc, a straight line, a circle arc
and another circle arc.
The first and last arcs consist of two curve segments (5 nodes).
The straight line and the second arc consist of one curve segment each.}
\label{fig:Cam}
\end{figure}

\remark{It is worth noticing that a sudden change in radii of the curve gives a
discontinuity in the second derivative, resulting in sudden forces in the cam.}

The default master-slave based cam parameterization has full rotational freedom
of the slave link relative to the follower, as well as translational DOFs in
the local $x$- and $y$-direction of the follower, which gives
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_3(\tilde u,\tilde v,\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:CamDef}
\end{equation}
%
The translational DOFs can be suppressed entirely, and individually,
which give the following three alternative formulations for the cam joint:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
{\mf P}_{SG} &=& {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_3(\tilde u,\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ} \label{eq:CamFixY} \\
%
{\mf P}_{SG} &=& {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_3(\tilde v,\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ} \label{eq:CamFixX} \\
%
{\mf P}_{SG} &=& {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_3(\tilde\theta_z)
{\mf P}_2(\tilde\theta_y)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ} \label{eq:CamFixBoth}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The rotation can also be parameterized using rotation axis components as for the
ball-, free- and cylindric joints, i.e., instead of \eqnref{eq:CamDef} we have:
%
\begin{equation}
{\mf P}_{SG} \:=\; {\mf P}_{JG}(s,\cdots)
{\mf P}_1(\tilde u,\tilde v,\tilde\theta_z,\tilde\theta_y,\tilde\theta_x)
{\mf P}_{SJ}
\label{eq:CamDef2}
\end{equation}
%
and similarly for~\meqsref{eq:CamFixY}{eq:CamFixBoth}.

\section{Master and Slave based Transmissions}

Master and slave based transmissions are expressed using linear dependencies
between selected joint variables of the various joint types described above.


\subsection{Gear Joint}

The gear joint is based on two revolute joints, one for the input shaft and one
for the output shaft.
The master triads for these two joints must be placed on the same link---the
gear housing.
Setting the gear ratio to $N$, the linear dependency of the rotational joint
DOFs becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\theta_{z_O} \;=\; N\,\theta_{z_I}
\label{eq:GearConstraint}
\end{equation}
%
where subscript $O$ designates the output shaft, and $I$ the input shaft.


\subsection{Rack and Pinion}

The rack--and--pinion is based on a revolute joint and a prismatic joint.
The master triads of the revolute joint and prismatic joint should be placed
on the same link---the joint housing.
The linear dependency of the rack--and--pinion becomes
%
\begin{equation}
s_O \;=\; N\,\theta_{z_I}
\label{eq:RackAndPinionConstraint}
\end{equation}
%
when using subscript $O$ for the slider variable of the prismatic joint,
and subscript $I$ for the rotational DOF of the input shaft.


\subsection{Screw Joint}

The screw joint is based on a cylindric joint.
The slider DOF is now connected to the rotational DOF about the joint $z$-axis,
which gives the linear dependency
